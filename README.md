## Description

Using the OpenWeather API I created simple React + TypeScript Weather App, where users can search for any city and instantly view its current weather conditions. User can navigate between cities, explore detailed forecasts for the upcoming hours, and access a variety of additional weather-related data. 

With our intuitive interface and robust functionality, users can easily toggle between cities to stay informed about weather updates across different locations. Plus, enhance your visual experience with dynamically changing background videos that reflect the weather conditions of the selected city.

Utilizing TailwindCSS for sleek and responsive styling. With comprehensive unit testing using React Testing Library and Vitest, rest assured that our app is reliable and performs optimally.
